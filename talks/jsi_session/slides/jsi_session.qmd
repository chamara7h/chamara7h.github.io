[Project 01: Family planning demand forecasting]{.highlight-title}

<br>

::: {.fragment}

**Problem**

- Stock decisions are risk-based, point forecasts are not enough

- Real LMIS data are irregular and often short-history

- Planners need a transparent adjustment mechanism to incorporate expert knowledge

:::


::: {.fragment}

**What we built**

- Hybrid approach: Combine probabilistic forecast with expert point forecast

- Benchmark a wide range of forecasting methods for contraceptive forecasting

:::

![](images/project1_img1.svg)

:::

::: {.column width="2.5%"}

:::

::: {.column width="47.5%"}

<br>

::: {.fragment}

**Outputs**

- Facility-level probabilistic forecasts (quantiles & intervals)

- Hybrid method that balances accuracy and computational requirements

- Guidance on when to use which method family

- A hands-on training on demand forecasting for contraceptives

:::

::: {.fragment}

**Key message**

- Use stable baselines by default; escalate to richer models selectively

- Treat bias adjustment as a governance issue (who can override, when, and why)

[Project 02: Demand forecasting with lost sales]{.highlight-title}

<br>

::: {.fragment}

**Problem**

- Observed consumption underestimates true need when shelves are empty

- Stockouts create partial censoring

- Interruptions/closures create full censoring

- Biased data → biased forecasts → under-ordering cycles

:::


::: {.fragment}

**What we built**

- Truncated Conformal Kalman Filter (TCKF), forecasting method that adapts under lost sales

- Prediction intervals suitable for decision rules (e.g., order-up-to policies)

:::

:::

## Project 02: Demand forecasting with lost sales

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](images/project2_img2.svg)

:::

::: {.column width="2.5%"}

:::

::: {.column width="47.5%"}

<br>

::: {.fragment}

**Outputs**

- TCKF method for lost sales (stockouts and interruptions).

- Prediction intervals via conformal prediction.

- Integrated forecast and inventory pipeline linking accuracy to ordering decisions.

- Public health translation from stock outcomes to program impact.

:::

::: {.fragment}

**Key message**

- Stock data often hides need, so we must estimate “true demand,” not just forecast observed consumption.

- Evaluate methods by decision impact (availability/ public health), not forecast scores alone.

[Project 3: DHIS2/CHAP deployment for supply chain forecasting]{.highlight-title}

<br>

::: {.fragment}

**Problem**

- CHAP supports advanced probabilistic forecasting, mainly for morbidity use-cases 

- Supply chain forecasting is not routinely linked to inventory decisions in the same workflow

- Facility-level planning needs low-burden tools that run unattended across many series

:::


::: {.fragment}

**What we built**

- A model portability experiment inside the DHIS2/CHAP pipeline (cases → consumption) 

- A standard workflow that produces forecast objects (mean, quantiles, sample paths) and feeds an order-up-to inventory simulation

:::

![](images/project3_img3.svg)

:::

::: {.column width="2.5%"}

:::

::: {.column width="47.5%"}

<br>

::: {.fragment}

**Outputs**

- Portability evidence across accuracy, uncertainty, runtime, and failure risk

- A practical default set: Auto ARIMA / Auto ETS as stable, scalable baselines

- A proposed end-to-end architecture and deployment steps

:::

::: {.fragment}

**Key message**

- Reuse the platform at scale, but treat model choice as conditional (target structure and decision context).

- Start with autonomous baselines; add complex models only where inputs and governance justify them.

[Project 4: Foundation/LLM models for public healthcare demand forecasting]{.highlight-title}

<br>

::: {.fragment}

**Problem**

- Foundational/ LLM models are trained on commercial-scale time series, but public health LMIS data are different 

- In LMIS we see intermittency, censoring, short histories, and data quality constraints 

- Their value for facility planning (zero-shot vs fine-tuned) is still unknown

:::


::: {.fragment}

**What we built**

- A controlled benchmark of foundation/LLM models vs strong statistical baselines on public health demand series 

- A Model Portability Matrix to explain when/why transfer works across domains, data regimes, and decision contexts

:::

::: {.column width="2.5%"}

:::

::: {.column width="57.5%"}

<br>

::: {.fragment}

**Outputs**

- A portability matrix covering: domain, data regime, model complexity and computational requirements

- Zero-shot vs fine-tuned results for models such as TimeGPT, Chronos, LagLlama, Moirai, TimesFM, etc

- Practical guidance: “*where foundation models help, where they don’t, and what to run instead*” 

:::

::: {.fragment}

**Key message**

- Treat foundation/LLM models as candidates, not defaults: test portability under LMIS realities before deployment.
