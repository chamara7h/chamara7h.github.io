    Our research focuses on judgmental forecast adjustments during pre-promotional (normal), promotional, and post-promotional periods through behavioral experiments. 
    The findings highlight the importance of providing forecasters with structured support to make effective adjustments, particularly during post-promotional periods. 
    Additionally, offering quantitative information can help mitigate harmful judgmental adjustments in these periods. 
    All materials related to the laboratory experiments will soon be available on my GitHub repository.
