    "section": "",
    "text": "My research focuses on addressing inefficiencies in supply chain management for contraceptive products in developing countries. These inefficiencies often lead to shortages, limiting women’s reproductive autonomy and exacerbating societal challenges. By integrating probabilistic forecasting with inventory optimization, I aim to create a novel approach that accounts for uncertainties, poor data quality, and local demand variations. This interdisciplinary project involves collaboration with scholars from Cardiff Business School, the School of Computer Science & Informatics, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The goal is to improve access to contraceptives, reduce unintended pregnancies, and prevent unsafe abortions, ultimately benefiting women, healthcare providers, governments, and donor organizations."

My research focuses on improving forecast methodologies for family planning supply chains in developing countries, with the goal of enhancing their efficiency and accessibility. In addition to my PhD work, I serve as the Coordinator and Training Lead at the Data Lab for Social Good.\nI also lead the research network at Forecasting for Social Good (F4SG), an official section of the International Institute of Forecasters. As part of this role, I manage the Learning Labs workshop series, providing free training on forecasting methodologies using R and Python. I am passionate about leveraging data science and forecasting techniques to address global challenges, and I actively engage with the forecasting and social good communities through workshops, collaborations, and research initiatives."
